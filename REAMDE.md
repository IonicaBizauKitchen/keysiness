I want to gather data on how long it takes people to type different words. Then
I want to train a regressor to predict the speed based on some number of 
features.


Possible Features
--------
* Length of word.
* Number of vowels in word (roughly number of syllables).
* Commonness of word.
* Percentage of keys on home row.
* Number of consecutive pairs of letters that are typed with the same finger.
* Average distance between each consecutive pair of keys.
